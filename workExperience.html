							<p>I started this internship by studying internal standards, ISO 12100 about machine safety, and ISO 13849 about safety related control systems. I applied this knowledge to write a hazard analysis compliant with ISO 12100 for a demonstration control panel. I then wrote a control risk assessment document and a control system design document for the same demonstration control panel to determine the required performance level as defined in ISO 13849, and then prove that the panel achieved the required performance level. </p>
							<p>I also got the opportunity to work on a new land being built. I assisted with power on and safety testing of animated figures with in the land. I worked with an internal testing department at Universal to develop safety tests for a figure within guests reach. I also worked with Weigl animation controllers to write a script to cycle the animated figures automatically. </p>

								<p>See Water Inc. is a UL508A control panel shop build liquid pumping panels. During my time at See Water, I worked on business automation, a cellular IOT Scada system, and developed a new product. </p>
								<p>I wrote multiple buisness automation programs for the company, including sales quote automation, BOM automation from AutoCad, inventory management automation integrated with NetSuite, and invoice notifications. </p>
								<p>I developed new hardware and firmware for Pump Portal, a product allowing customers to monitor and control their pumps from anywhere in the world. The hardware used before my work was in end of life, so I found an appropriate replacement and developed firmware to interface with the existing Pump Portal website. From this I learned about Modbus, as well as MQTT, a common IOT communication standard. I later developed a system using a single board computer along with a cellular router to bring down costs further. </p>
								<p>I developed firmware and hardware for a new product, a cellular connected high low level alarm (HLA) panel. This required me working on firmware for the microcontroller to drive the screen and input buttons, as well as monitoring floats and two transducers. This also included developing firmware for the cellular device to interface with the microcontroller and Pump Portal. </p>
